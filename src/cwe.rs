    /// ### Trusting HTTP Permission Methods on the Server Side
    ///
    /// The server contains a protection mechanism that assumes that any URI that is accessed using HTTP GET will not cause a state change to the associated resource. This might allow attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and conduct resource modification and deletion attacks, since some applications allow GET to modify state.
    Cwe650,

    /// ### Exposure of WSDL File Containing Sensitive Information
    ///
    /// The Web services architecture may require exposing a Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) file that contains information on the publicly accessible services and how callers of these services should interact with them (e.g. what parameters they expect and what types they return).
